Client client = new Client()
    .SetEndPoint("https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1") // Your API Endpoint
    .SetProject("<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>") // Your project ID
    .SetKey("<YOUR_API_KEY>") // Your secret API key
    .SetImpersonateUserId(""); // Impersonate a user by ID on an already user-authenticated request. Requires the current request to be authenticated as a user with impersonator capability; X-Appwrite-Key alone is not sufficient. Impersonator users are intentionally granted users.read so they can discover a target before impersonation begins. Internal audit logs still attribute actions to the original impersonator and record the impersonated target only in internal audit payload data.

Functions functions = new Functions(client);

byte[] result = await functions.GetDeploymentDownload(
    functionId: "<FUNCTION_ID>",
    deploymentId: "<DEPLOYMENT_ID>",
    type: DeploymentDownloadType.Source // optional
);```
