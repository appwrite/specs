```ruby
require 'appwrite'

include Appwrite
include Appwrite::Enums

client = Client.new
    .set_endpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1') # Your API Endpoint
    .set_project('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>') # Your project ID
    .set_key('<YOUR_API_KEY>') # Your secret API key
    .set_impersonate_user_id('') # Impersonate a user by ID on an already user-authenticated request. Requires the current request to be authenticated as a user with impersonator capability; X-Appwrite-Key alone is not sufficient. Impersonator users are intentionally granted users.read so they can discover a target before impersonation begins. Internal audit logs still attribute actions to the original impersonator and record the impersonated target only in internal audit payload data.

sites = Sites.new(client)

result = sites.get_deployment_download(
    site_id: '<SITE_ID>',
    deployment_id: '<DEPLOYMENT_ID>',
    type: DeploymentDownloadType::SOURCE # optional
)
