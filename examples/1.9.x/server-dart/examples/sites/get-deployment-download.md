Client client = Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://<REGION>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1') // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>') // Your project ID
    .setKey('<YOUR_API_KEY>') // Your secret API key
    .setImpersonateUserId(''); // Impersonate a user by ID on an already user-authenticated request. Requires the current request to be authenticated as a user with impersonator capability; X-Appwrite-Key alone is not sufficient. Impersonator users are intentionally granted users.read so they can discover a target before impersonation begins. Internal audit logs still attribute actions to the original impersonator and record the impersonated target only in internal audit payload data.

Sites sites = Sites(client);

Uint8List result = await sites.getDeploymentDownload(
    siteId: '<SITE_ID>',
    deploymentId: '<DEPLOYMENT_ID>',
    type: enums.DeploymentDownloadType.source, // (optional)
);
